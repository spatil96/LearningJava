some key aspects of Other.YAML syntax::
Scalars: These are simple values like strings, integers, and floats. In Other.YAML, scalars can be written without quotes,
         but quotes can be used to ensure that a value is interpreted as a string.
Lists: Represented as a sequence of items, each item in a list is preceded by a dash (-) and a space.
Maps: Also known as associative arrays or dictionaries, maps are represented as a collection of key-value pairs.
      Each pair is separated by a colon (:) and a space.
Comments: (#)
